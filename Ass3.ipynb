    "Following your graduation, you are hired by a polling organisation as a data analyst. As social media has exploded and transformed the way people interact with each other, it would be a great idea to use messages collected from social media to predict how the user can be converted to change his/her support. List three challenges to solving this problem. With reference to existing approaches, describe the design of your system. Discuss the ethical and social consequence of this study."

    "What is social media? let's look at each word individually. As for the\"social\" part, it means interacting with other people by receiving and sharing information and message with them. And \"media part\" means a kind of communication instrument, such as the internet and radio. We can pull a broad but basic definition: social media is a web-based communication tool and people could use it to interact with each other people by sharing or getting information. If we want to predict what it and why it will happen, we had better use the predictive model based on the associations between variables. Most of the predictive models could bring out customer data, such as historical and transactional data to find change and risks. The model could guide the user's decision for lead scoring. Three most normal models include prescriptive, predictive and descriptive."

    "One of the biggest challenges of data analysis is to determine whether the data itself has emotional factors.As for the classifying opinions, if make it as positive or negative, will make useful to gauge public sentiment towards a certain main topic and to know the customer feeling about the service and product. It is better-used sentiment analysis which is a process of mining subjective message from the original data and categorizing it. There are five main flavours and types of the polarity of the opinion, from the focus on polarity(positive, negative) to identify intentions(such as interested or uninterested). For example, very positive, positive, neutral, negative and very negative. "

    "The extreme emotional data can be avoided to a great extent by detecting and analyzing emotions while collecting data. The purpose of emotion detection is detecting user emotion, such as sadness, happiness, anger and more. But the disadvantages are people will use lots of different emotions words, such as \"kill\", \"marvellous\" or \"bull shit\". Another disadvantage is the words of subjectivity and tone. The detection of subjective and objective texts is also the same as important as analyzing tone. For example, there are two texts: The iPhone is pretty good./ The iPhone is black. Perhaps in the majority opinion, the first one is positive and the second is neutral. In these examples, pretty good is more subjective than red."
